# SteamStream

**Elevate your couch experience!** SteamStream is a single, convenient website that aggregates links to all your favorite streaming services (Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, Disney+, Prime Video, HBO Max, etc.).

Instead of adding *each* service individually as a separate "Non-Steam Game", you only need to add **SteamStream once**. From there, you can access all your services directly within Steam's Big Picture mode.

### üí° Tips & Tricks

#### üîß Linux

*   **Find Browser Paths:** Use the terminal to locate your browser if the path isn't standard:
    ```bash
    which google-chrome firefox chromium brave-browser
    # Or check common directories:
    ls /usr/bin/*chrome* /usr/bin/firefox*
    ```
*   **Controller Support:** Enhance controller navigation by setting up custom Steam Input configurations for your browser.
*   **GPU Issues:** If you encounter graphical glitches, try adding `--disable-gpu` or `--disable-gpu-sandbox`.

#### ü™ü Windows

*   **Clean UI:** Add `--disable-infobars` and `--no-first-run` to minimize browser pop-ups.
*   **Edge Quirks:** Sometimes adding `--no-startup-window` helps Edge launch correctly in kiosk mode.
